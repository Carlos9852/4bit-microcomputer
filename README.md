#  MikroLeo
## 4-bit Didactic Microcomputer

<!-- This is a comment -->

The project is in the final testing stage.  
This project was developed mainly for educational purposes.  
It is a fully open-source hardware and software project.  
Soon, the project files will be here!

- 16 inputs
- single cycle instruction
- 3 execution modes:
   * step
   * 3MHz (precise time)
   * adjustable clock speed
- no MPU/MCU or complex chips
- RISC architecture
- no microcode
- Built with 74HCTxxx integrated circuits
